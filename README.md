# TFM - Recommender Systems & Fairness

This repository contains the final project for a Master's degree, focused on the development, analysis, and evaluation of **recommender systems**, with a strong emphasis on **algorithmic fairness** and the **mitigation of popularity bias**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `TFM_Recommender_Systems_&_Fairness.ipynb`

This notebook includes:
- The **implementation of various recommender system models**, primarily based on **Collaborative Filtering** techniques.
- Advanced experimentation and evaluation procedures.
- **Dimensionality reduction using clustering methods**, aimed at improving both performance and computational efficiency.
- Comparative analysis of models using traditional and fairness-aware metrics.

### 2. `Train_&_Evaluation.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on:
- **Training and evaluating each model** using **5-Fold Cross-Validation**, ensuring statistically significant and robust results.
- The implementation of **U1R and U3R protocols**, specifically designed to **mitigate popularity bias** in recommendations.
- A comprehensive comparison of model performance **before and after applying bias mitigation strategies**.

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to explore how fairness-aware mechanisms and evaluation protocols can be integrated into recommender systems, ensuring not only accuracy but also equity and representation across user groups and items.

## üìä Key Topics
- Collaborative Filtering
- Fairness in Machine Learning
- Popularity Bias Mitigation
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Cross-Validation
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy & Fairness)

## üìÅ Files
- `TFM_Recommender_Systems_&_Fairness_Small.ipynb`: Model development and experimentation.
- `TrainEvaluation5fold.ipynb`: Statistical evaluation and fairness protocol implementation.
